(btw i am NOT assosciated with pekora at all this is made so people can stop asking if pekora is malware.)
HEY THERE!
This project is just the new pekora bootstrapper but its actually signed with microsoft SDK tools using the SignTool
you can do this by yourself, just make sure you have some experience in signing
https://developer.microsoft.com/hr-hr/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/ THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN GET THE SDK TOOL TO SIGN IT YOURSELF (please dont mind its croatian)
Thank you for your understanding
